I am an ex-instance of DTRHunspell or one of its other subclasses. I became a zombie when #invalidate was sent to me (usually when the VM was restarted) which deprived me of my hunspell handle pointer.

When you send me api* messages to call hunspell functionality, I will transparently revive myself and my class will be changed to what is returned by DTRHunspell class>>platformSpecificSubclass.
